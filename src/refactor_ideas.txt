Chad's User Story:

As a Park Manager I want to unsubmit a job
A job can be unsubmitted only if the job starts at least a minimum number of days in the future.

acceptance tests from Volunteer class:
Volunteer unvolunteers for a job that starts on the current day
Volunteer unvolunteers for a multi-day job that starts prior to the current day
Volunteer unvolunteers for a job that starts more than the minumum number of days in the future
Volunteer unvolunteers for a job that starts exactly the minumum number of days in the future



7) As a Park Manager I want to view the future jobs that I have submitted.
